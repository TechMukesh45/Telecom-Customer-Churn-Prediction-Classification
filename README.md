# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Classification
This repository contains code and data for developing predictive models to identify potential churners in the telecom industry. Customer churn, the voluntary discontinuation of services by subscribers, impacts revenue and customer retention. The dataset includes features related to customer behavior, billing, and payment history. The project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models using classifiers such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting. Exploratory data analysis, feature analysis, data preprocessing techniques, model selection, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning are performed to build an effective predictive model for customer churn.
